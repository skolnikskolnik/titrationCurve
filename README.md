## Description: 
A student, teacher, or researcher can generate what certain titration curves will look like under various conditions. Users also create a database of common acids.

This application is deployed in <a href='https://mighty-tundra-34283.herokuapp.com/'>heroku.</a>   

A user can select from acids already in the database and set reaction conditions for their titration.

This generates the titration curve:

If the acid is not already in the database, the user can enter it in themselves either as pKa or Ka:

## Installation instructions: 
Express, mysql, charts.js are required to run this program.

## Usage: 
This is geared towards chemistry teachers who want to be able to easily generate titration curves to use in practice problems.

## Contributions: 
This is currently a solo project for skolnikskolnik.

## Testing instructions: 
Generate a titration curve and see what it looks like. This does require that the user has a strong chemistry background.
